# Exterkamp Dot Codes!

Welcome to the source code of my website!  If you want to hack around on it go ahead and feel free.
It is a basic react app, so there isn't too much to see, but I hope you have as much fun hacking on it
as I did making it!

## To run the react app locally

This will run the app locally on port 3000.
```bash
$ yarn start
```

## To deploy the app to gh-pages

This will deploy the app to github pages master branch
```bash
$ yarn deploy
```
