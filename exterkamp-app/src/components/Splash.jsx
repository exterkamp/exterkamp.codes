                                I got a degree in Computer Science from the University of Florida, Go Gators! While I was there I met a lot of great people
                                and built a lot of fun things!  I was happy to go to a few UF Hackathons i.e. <i>Swamp Hacks</i>!  I focused a lot on Java
                                in school and also did some android development way back on KitKat.  I also got to work with a really cool 
                                company <a target="_target" href="https://www.infotechfl.com">InfoTech</a> for my Senior Project with 
                                the <a target="_target" href="http://www.ippd.ufl.edu/">IPPD</a> program where I got my first taste of the cloud.

                                After graduating I started working at <a target="_target" href="http://nielsen.com">Nielsen</a>.  I have worked in Research 
                                and Development, US Television Audience Measurement and Enterprise Core Technology.  This exposure to so many areas has given 
                                me a very large breadth of experience in technology and moved me away from Java centric development to work in Python, 
                                Javascript, Ansible, React, Angular, Redux, on AWS, Azure and GCP!

                                I am just starting in my career as a software developer, and I am always looking for the next thing to learn and
                                do to make tech everywhere better!

                                    Outside of making software I enjoy expressing my creative side.  I love photography, both digitally and on 35mm.  To the
                                    left is my Olympus OM-2S!  I'm still new to developing my own film, but it is addictive and I am doing it more and more in
                                    addition to shooting digital.

                                    I also sometimes paint in acrylic and watercolor.  When not feeling colorful I draw in graphite and occasionally in ink.
